        I believe that i have met the requirements. I created a website for the JMU Accounting club that was formed
        last year. The website contains five different pages: Home, News, Meet the Firms, Mentorships, and Sign Up.
        The site includes a header and external links to recruiters sites and navigation links to other pages. The media 
        query handles the 2 columns and turns it into one column when it is under 600px, moving the pictures under the 
        content. The page contains coherent styles throughout each page and repeated styles are placed in the main 
        css page. All images have accurate alt tags to describe them accurately and each page 
        contains its favicon. The css styles are in a folder called css and the images are in a file called images. The content 
        has been validated by the W3Câ€™s Nu Validator.
        The content is addequately spaced and uses two different font faces, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif and the base font. 
        the source code uses kebab-case instead of camelCase. There is an animation of a finger pointing 
        to the sign up button and it changes to a thumbs-up when sign upis followed. I have shared the repo with 
        "twodee" and all the file names are lowercase. The site is avaiable by both the required domains as well 
        as reroutes to https everytime. I have had a few commits before the final day and this is the report. 
        This has covered all the requirements.
